# Age-and-gender-Prediction

Problem Statement:

In this project, we need to create a model to predit the automatic age and gender classification.

CNN model is used to create the facial recognition to predit the age and gender. Two convolution layers and one fully connected layer is used in this model.

Workflow of the project:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Data Preparation
4. Design Convolutional Neural Network
5. Training and Saving the model
6. Restore mode

The model did a pretty good job in finding the age and gender and the accuracy of the model was about 72%
